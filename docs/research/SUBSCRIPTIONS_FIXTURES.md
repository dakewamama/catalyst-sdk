# Subscriptions fixture contract

Baseline and verified semantics: [SUBSCRIPTIONS_SEMANTICS.md](SUBSCRIPTIONS_SEMANTICS.md).
These are fixtures required before expanding adapter claims. Fixed and recurring
delegations have native and semantic goldens. Subscription lifecycle has a native
capture; its semantic projection and control actions remain the next gate.
Upstream test paths refer to the pinned source in that document.

Every captured case must include program/token ELF hashes, source revisions,
account addresses/owners/raw bytes before and after, clock slot/timestamp, native
instruction bytes/accounts, outcome and expected ARM. Use absolute clocks and
independent slots. Keep successful and rejected transitions; failures must leave
state unchanged. Unsupported versions and absent dependency evidence are separate.

| Fixture | Native operation and assertion | Existing upstream evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technical authority | Initialize; ATA delegates finite `u64::MAX` to PDA, without granting that amount to a merchant | `test_initialize_subscription_authority.rs`, `test_revoke_subscription_authority.rs` |
| Fixed | Create cap 100; pull 40 to a third party; remaining 60; pull 61 fails with native error 300 and leaves all accounts unchanged; delegator revokes while the shared token approval remains | Captured in `tests/fixtures/subscriptions-fixed.json` with pinned SBF and Token ELF hashes; upstream: `test_create_fixed_delegation.rs`, `test_transfer_fixed_delegation.rs`, `test_revoke_delegation.rs` |
| Recurring | Cap 100, period 30; pull 60; remaining 40; exceed rejected; skip periods and prove only one current cap, not accumulation | Captured in `tests/fixtures/subscriptions-recurring.json`; upstream: `test_transfer_recurring_delegation.rs` |
| Finite boundary | Test expiry minus one, expiry and expiry plus one; exhausted final period never receives another cap | Captured in the recurring fixture; host helper `catch_up_at_exact_expiry_boundary_succeeds` also executed |
| Subscription | Owner plus allowed puller share one cap; destination wallet whitelist checked; arbitrary third party caller rejected | `test_transfer_subscription.rs` |
| Pending cancellation | Cancel midway; cutoff at period boundary; pull remains possible before cutoff and fails at cutoff | `test_cancel_subscription.rs`, `test_transfer_subscription.rs` |
| Resume | Resume pending cancellation with observed cutoff; consumed amount and period preserved; stale expiry/generation rejected | `test_resume_subscription.rs` |
| Immediate cancellation | Both signatures and observed period start; cutoff now; single subscription stopped while another on same authority survives | `test_cancel_subscription_now.rs` |
| Active but inactive spending | Preserve subscription state while directly revoking token delegate, freezing/emptying source or closing authority; do not report collectible Spend | `test_transfer_recurring_delegation.rs`, README collectability section |
| Generation | Close/recreate in same slot versus later slot; old binding can survive only matching generation; sponsor recovery waits past creation slot | `test_co_init_slot.rs`, `test_revoke_abandoned_delegation.rs`, `test_revoke_abandoned_subscription.rs` |
| Plan lineage and administration | Sunset keeps existing pull rights; removing puller changes principal set; term mismatch/closed plan blocks collection; reject stale plan edit | `test_update_plan.rs`, `test_transfer_subscription.rs`, `test_subscribe.rs` |
| Global revoke | Revoke matching token approval and close authority; recompile all dependent grant states; foreign token delegate remains | `test_revoke_subscription_authority.rs` |

Capture fixed, recurring and subscription inputs from successful native creates,
not handwritten protocol layouts. The upstream harness creates some token fixtures
by installing native account data; record that distinction. Catalyst goldens should
reproduce the relevant state through official instructions when practical.

Additional negative variants: wrong owner/kind/length/version, authority address or
generation mismatch, missing signature, recipient violation, foreign delegate,
sponsor recipient mismatch, mint/token-program mismatch and failed CPI rollback.
Observe a removed account explicitly; absence from an incomplete scan is not revoke.

Token-2022 fee/hook examples are dependency tests, not automatic extension support.
First adapter scope should use classic SPL and an explicitly verified Token-2022
subset. Hooks must either supply complete interpreted dependencies or remain
unsupported for exact effective claims. Never add hook authorization to ARM simply
because a TransferContext exists.

Retained-signature scenarios require an actually held, still-valid transaction or
equivalent native instruction sequence with pinned state. Different-timestamp stale
approvals are already covered upstream; same-second/same-period/ABA and held init
bundles are documented residual behavior. Preserve them as limits until locally
reproduced. No fabricated model gap may be inferred from a test name or audit label.

## Acceptance

Raw native state must decode through the official client, compile to stable ARM,
and retain sufficient evidence for replay. Native revoke/cancel/resume must execute,
re-observe and recompile. A declared Diff must agree with the observed semantic
change, including shared authority effects and preserved unrelated permissions.
All existing SPL goldens must still pass. Unknown deployments remain unsupported.

The fixed-delegation SVM capture uses program source
56de552a26a0f0af437c0ce5191b3309741cc596, official Rust client subscriptions
0.5.0 from 5a347ffaa969036061d274d3c91e0277962e2b51, and Mollusk 0.15.1.
Its fixture records exact instructions and accounts before and after each
transition. Token mint and account setup data are installed by the harness;
authority and delegation state are created by native instructions. This is a
local fixture, not a live deployment claim. subscriptions-fixed-arm.json contains
the expected technical and derived records after the partial pull. The adapter's
native revoke executes and recompiles to the surviving technical approval.

Additional native tests prove sponsored rent return, unsigned rejection, inclusive
expiry, zero/maximum expiry, token revoke, and authority closure/recreation in the
same versus a later slot. Platform-tools v1.54 built the pinned program for this capture.

The recurring capture reuses the same source/client revisions and ELF hashes. Its
13 transitions prove a 100-unit cap with a 30-second period, rejected overspend,
catch-up after three skipped periods without accumulated allowance, final-period
consumption before and at inclusive expiry, expiry rejection and delegator revoke.
Rejected transfers leave every native account unchanged, including a failed rollover.
subscriptions-recurring-arm.json specifies the separate technical approval and derived
recurring grant after a 60-unit pull. Projection derives an unpersisted rollover from
the bank clock; it does not pretend a rejected transaction committed that rollover.
Native tests also create an unbounded grant with a future start and prove its time gate.
DelegationAdapter version 0.2 handles both kinds and proves revoke/Diff/recompilation
for each.

subscriptions-lifecycle.json captures 41 native transitions with the same pinned
program/client and ELF hashes. Plans use 100-unit hourly budgets. Owner and puller
share one cap, while the recipient whitelist is independent of the caller. Pending
cancellation permits a pull before its exclusive cutoff. Resume rejects a stale
cutoff and preserves consumption; it fails at the cutoff. Subscriber revoke closes
only the cancelled subscription and preserves the shared approval.

Re-subscription reuses the PDA with a later period start. A retained immediate-cancel
instruction for the earlier start fails. Immediate cancellation requires both
signatures. Another subscription using the same authority still collects to an
unrestricted recipient. Sunset permits existing collection but rejects a new
subscription. Every rejected instruction leaves every account unchanged. This
capture also rejects stale subscribe terms/generation, premature subscriber revoke
and stale plan updates. Sunset permits puller removal but rejects restoration;
the removed puller loses collection authority. At finite plan end, cancellation
is capped at end plus one and the final period's remaining budget is collectible
through the inclusive end. Collection fails one second later. This does not yet
prove the subscription ARM projection, live support, global revoke or authority
closure/recreation behavior for subscriptions.
